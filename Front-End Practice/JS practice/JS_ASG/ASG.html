            <p><strong>Answere:</strong>
                To embed audio in HTML, we use the <mark> &lt;audio&gt;</mark> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added
                to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the
                release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three
                audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.
            <p><strong>Syntax: Audio & Video</strong></p>

            </h4>
            <strong>Answere:</strong>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part
                of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic
                pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because
                of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995
                with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape,
                Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
            <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
                <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>

                <li>What is the use of isNaN function? </li>
            </h4>
            <strong>Answere:</strong>
            <p>NaN stands for Not a Number. It’s a special floating point value that is used to indicate that a result
                is
                undefined or unrepresentable. I personally see it as the result returned in embedded systems when a
                sensor is
                disconnected.</p>
            <p>NaN is not less than, greater than, equal to or not equal to any numeric value. It’s also not equal to
                itself.
                That means that you can’t test whether a variable contains NaN simply by testing whether it is equal to
                NaN. It
                can’t ever be. Thus, we have the isnan macro to allow us to write the code to test for it.</p>

            <strong>Answere:</strong>
            <p>Negative infinity is the smallest number.</p>
            <p>On the number-line, the right of zero are positive numbers starting from 1 and left of zero are negative
                numbers starting from -1. If somebody ask me how far can you go right on the number line, I would say
                infinity. And if somebody ask me how far can you go left on the number-line, I would say negative
                infinity.</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Confirm box</li>

                <p>Usually, when the user clicks a link on a page a new page loads, but this is not always the desired
                    course of action. For example, when the user clicks a link on a page, you might want to update the
                    value of a field in a form or the value of a variable. To prevent a page from reloading when a link
                    is clicked, the void(0) function is used.</p>
                <b>Example:</b>
                <p>
                    &lt;a href=" " onclick=" alert ( ' You have clicked the button ' ) > Click here ! &lt;/a&gt; </p>
                <p>Click on the above link. Even though the code within it specifies to display a message in an alert
                    box (and this action does take place), the page will reload automatically.</p>
                <p>We can fix this with void(0): </p>
                <p> &lt;a href = " javascript : void ( 0 ) ; " onclick = " alert ( ' You have clicked the button ' )&gt;
                    Click here ! &lt;/a&gt;

                <strong>Answere:</strong>
                <p>In this article, we will see how can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <P><b>Approach:</b> We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another
                    page in
                    Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the
                    document.
                    We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</P>
                <p>Syntax:</p>
                <p>
                    &lt;script> <br>
                    window .location = &lt;Path / URL> <br>
                    &lt;/script>
                </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>
                    &lt;script> <br>
                    window .location = "https://www.google.com/" <br>
                    &lt;/script>
                </p>
                <p>So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location Object inside Javascript we can
                    change the
                    URL of our window and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our Javascript without any href
                    tag. We will
                    build a small working sample to learn it practically.

                <h4>
                    <li>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</li>
                </h4>
                <strong>Answere:</strong>
                <p>The use of <b>innerHTML</b> very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents
                    as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.</p>
                <p>Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the
                    new elements
                    created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and
                    attach it
                    to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
                </p>
                <p>Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage
                    usinginnerHTML,
                    all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed andrecreated.</p>
                <p>Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on
                    appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
                    Example:</p>
                <p> &lt;p id="xyz" >ABC &lt;/p> <br>
                    title = document.getElementById('#xyz')</p>
                <p>// The whole "ABC" tag is reparsed <br>
                    title.innerHTML += '&lt;p> example &lt;/p>'</p>
                <p><b> Old content replaced issue:</b> The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML =
                    object.innerHTML + ‘html’ is used instead of object.innerHTML += ‘html’. There is no way of
                    appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very
                    slow. String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the
                    plus’ and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track.</p>
                <p><b> Can break the document:</b> There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid
                    HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used,
                    which may lead to unexpected problems.</p>
                <p><b> Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS):</b> The fact that innerHTML can add text and
                    elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable
                    or harmful elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak
                    and change of sensitive information.
