    <p><b>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</b></p>
    <p>
      HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the
      content. HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an
      HTML element in detail. Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML
      elements.

    <p><b>What are tags and attributes in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning
      and end of an HTML element in an HTML document. As part of an HTML
      element, HTML tags help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control
      the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element
      type.

    <p><b>What are void element in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      Elements with no closing tag are known as an empty tag. For eg: br, link,
      img, hr, meta, source etc. Since we can not specify anything in between
      those. HTML element which does not have a closing tag are called Empty
      elements or Void elements
    </p>

    <p><b>What are HTML Entities?</b></p>
    <p>
      An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand
      ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ) . Entities are frequently used to
      display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML
      code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces)
    </p>
    <div class="tableentity">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Result</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Entity Name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&</td>
          <td>ampersand</td>
          <td>&amp;amp</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>"</td>
          <td>double quotation mark</td>
          <td>&amp;quot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>'</td>
          <td>single quotation mark (apostrophe)</td>
          <td>&apos</td>

    <p><b>What are different types of lists in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>There are three list types in HTML:</p>
    <div class="typeoflist">
      <ul>
        <li>
          unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular
          order.
        </li>
        <li>
          ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific
          order.
        </li>
        <li>
          description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and
          definitions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <p><b>What is the 'class' attribute in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The
      class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
      However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make
      changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b
        >What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class'
        attribute of HTML elements?
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can
      only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to
      multiple elements.

    <p><b>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</b></p>
    <p>
      Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's
      border and the content present in it. Cellspacing basically defines the
      space present between individual adjacent cells.

      <b
        >How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column
        in an HTML table?
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can merge two or more table cells in a column using the colspan
      attribute in a &lt;td&gt; HTML tag (table data). To merge two or more row
      cells, use the rowspan attribute.

      <b
        >What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline
        element?</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency.
      Inline elements don't start in a new line. Block elements always start in
      a line. Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind
    </p>

    <p><b>How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt;
      tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The &lt;a&gt; tag
      indicates where the hyperlink starts and the &lt;/a&gt; tag indicates
      where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a
      hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the &lt;a href=” ”&gt;.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><b>What is the use of an iframe tag?</b></p>
    <p>
      The &lt;iframe&gt; tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used
      to embed another document within the current HTML document.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><b>What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</b></p>
    <p>
      The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a
      text, or a part of a document. The &lt;span&gt; tag is easily styled by
      CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The
      &lt;span&gt; tag is much like the &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; is
      a block-level element and &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.

    <p><b>How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?</b></p>
    <p>
      To set the background image of a webpage, use the CSS style. Under the CSS
      &lt;style&gt; tag, add the property background-image. The property sets a
      graphic such as jpg, png, svg, gif, etc. HTML5 do not support the
      &lt;body&gt; background attribute, so CSS is used to change set background
      image.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><b>How are active links different from normal links? </b></p>
    <p>
      Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed
      over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus.
      Those that don't have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal
      link. Some browser recognize active links when the mouse cursor is placed
      over that link
    </p>

    <p><b>What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</b></p>
    <p>There are three tags that can be used to separate the texts:</p>
    <div class="separatetag">
      <ul>
        <li>
          &lt;br&gt; tag - Usually &lt;br&gt; tag is used to separate the line
          of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next
          line.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;p&gt; tag - This contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;blockquote&gt; tag - It is used to define a large quoted section.

    <p><b>What is SVG? </b></p>
    <p>

    <p><b>What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      HTML is SGML-based while XHTML is XML-based. They are like two sides of
      the same coin. XHTML was derived from HTML to conform to XML standards.
      Hence XHTML is strict when compared to HTML and does not allow user to get
      away with lapses in coding and structure.

    <p><b>What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      Logical tags are used to provide information by giving the special
      importance to the text. For instance, &lt;em&gt; tag is used to emphasize
      the text by representing it in italic format. Physical tags are used to
      style the content only. For instance, &lt;i&gt; is used to display the
      text in italic format
