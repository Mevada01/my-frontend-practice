                        <h2>Statue of Unity</h2>
                        <p>The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3]
                            located in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian statesman and independence
                            activist Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home
                            minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel was highly respected
                            for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India to form the single Union of
                            India. In Gujarat the statue is found on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing
                            the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the city of Vadodara.</p>
                        <p>Statue of Unity Movement was started in 2013 to collect the iron needed for the statue by
                            asking farmers to donate their used farming instruments. By 2016, a total of 135 metric
                            tonnes of scrap iron had been collected and about 109 tonnes of it was used to make the
                            foundation of the statue after processing. A marathon titled Run For Unity was held on 15
                            December 2013 in Surat and Vadodara in support of the project.</p>

                        <h2>Garba</h2>
                        <p>It is a type of Indian dance form mainly performed at festivals and other special occasions
                            in Gujarat state, India. It is also spelled as garaba, singular garbo.
                            This style of dance is based on a circular pattern and is characterised by a sweeping action
                            performed side to side. The performances of Garba also include singing and musical
                            accompaniment traditionally provided by dhol and similar but smaller dholak, hand-clapping,
                            and assorted metallic idiophones, like cymbals.</p>
                        <p>Garba originated from the Sanskrit word Garbha meaning the womb. Customarily, this dance form
                            in Gujarat marks a girl's first menstrual cycle and later, her imminent marriage. It is also
                            performed during the nine-day Navratri festival which is held annually during the month of
                            Ashwin (September or October). On some occasions, men also participate but women are the
                            main performers of Garba.</p>

                        <p>The Lakshmi Vilas Palace in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, was constructed by the Gaekwad family,
                            a prominent Maratha family, who ruled the Baroda State. Major Charles Mant was credited to
                            be the main architect of the palace.</p>
                        <p>It is reputed to have been the largest private dwelling built until that time, and four times
                            the size of Buckingham Palace. At the time of construction, it boasted the most modern
                            amenities such as elevators and the interior is reminiscent of a large European country
                            house.[1] It remains the residence of the royal family, who continue to be held in high
                            esteem by the residents of Baroda.
                            The Palace compound is of over 500 acres and houses a number of buildings, particularly the
                            LVP Banquets & Conventions, Moti Bagh Palace and the Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum building.
                            In the 1930s Maharaja Pratapsinh created a golf course for use by his European guests. In
                            the 1990s, Pratapsinh's grandson Samarjitsinh, a former Ranji trophy cricket player,
                            renovated the course and opened it to the public.</p>

                        <h2>Dwarka Temple</h2>
                        <p>As per Hindu legend, Dwarka was built on a piece of land by Krishna that was reclaimed from
                            the sea. Sage Durvasa once visited Krishna and his wife Rukmini. The sage wished that the
                            pair took him to their palace. The pair readily agreed and started walking with the sage to
                            their palace. After some distance, Rukmini got tired and she requested some water from
                            Krishna. Krishna dug a mythical hole that brought in river Ganga to the place. Sage Durvasa
                            was furious and cursed Rukmini to remain in the place. The temple where Rukmini's shrine is
                            found, is believed to the place where she stood.</p>
                        <p>The town of Dwarka in Gujarat has a history that dates back centuries, and mentioned in the
                            Mahabharat epic as the Dwaraka Kingdom. Situated on the banks of river Gomti, the town is
                            described in legend as the capital of Krishna. Evidence such as a stone block with script,
                            the way the stones were dressed showing that dowels had been used, and an examination of
                            anchors found on the site suggest that the harbour site dates only to historical times, with
                            some of the underwater structure being late Medieval. Coastal erosion was probably the cause
                            of the destruction of what was an ancient port.</p>
